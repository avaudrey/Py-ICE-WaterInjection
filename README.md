# Py-ICE-WaterInjection
Numerical modelling of water injection processes in intake manifolds of Internal Combustion Engines.

## Introduction

The **"port" injection of water** into the intakes of Internal Combustion Engines (ICE), also known as **fumigation**, is an old and well known strategy to improve their performances and decrease their tail pipe pollutions. The water latent heat of vaporization creates a cooling effect of the fresh mixture and then increase the engine _volumetric efficiency_. The required work of compression and the maximum flame temperature decrease as well. Hovewer, it is easy to imagine that, beyond a critical amount, the injection of water will have a negative influence of the the engine performances.
